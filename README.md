# fourier-boolean

## Description

This is a simple project to deal with boolean functions using fourier transform. 

latex files in `src` is the solutions manual of the exercises in ryan o'donnell's book [Analysis of Boolean functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10386)

`fourier_expansion.py` is a python script to calculate the fourier expansion of a boolean function.

I will update some codes to test mathematical computation in the future.

This repository is still under construction and will be updated soon.
